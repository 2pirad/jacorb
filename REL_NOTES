 -------------------------------------------

1.3.21
        - internal redesign: all package names now begin with "org.jacorb"
          NOTE: You MUST change existing jacorb.properties files to 
          reflect these changes where property values point to JacORB
          classes, e.g. the value for property:

              org.omg.PortableInterceptor.ORBInitializerClass.standard_init

          must be changed to:

              org.jacorb.orb.standardInterceptors.IORInterceptorInitializer

        - IDL compiler:
                . added the -nostub switch to suppress generation of client stubs
                . added the -sloppy_forward switch for forward declared interfaces
                  without definitions
                . name resolution bug fixed
                . stricter checks in lots of places (thanks to Paul Locke)
                . minor bug fixes

        - Any marshalling bugs for alias types fixed

        - fixed diverse bugs in wstring support

        - enhanced dior tool to display character codeset information

        - fixed minor bug in internal buffer management

        - fixed bug in fallback code after a non-permanent ForwardRequest
          by a portable interceptor

        - added few properties to allow for tailor-made authentication
          implementations (aka PrincipalAuthenticator). Also fixed a 
          few minor glitches in the SSL setup, so that we can now 
          interoperate with, e.g., Orbacus' SSL.

1.3.11:

        - fixed two minor but annoying syntax errors in the source
          code... (jacorb/ir/gui/ModelBuilder.java and 
          jacorb/orb/domain/gui/BrowserFrame.java). Also fixed
          broken jacorb.jar file

                - name server: fixed a problem with reloading persistent state  
                        after restarting
