 -------------------------------------------

1.3.30

        - IDL compiler bug fixes:

             fixed bugs in constant expressions

             Compiler now resets internal table between IDL files passed
                on the same command line

             Compiler did not complain if oneway operations declare 
                exceptions or return types other than void. Now it does.

             Compiler did not complain about identifiers in the same
                scope that differedonly in case, which it should according
                to the spec. Now it correctly rejects definitions like 
                "teST" and "TEst".

             Compiler did not check the IDL 2.3 rules for redefinition of
                interfaces etc. in nested scopes, now it does. (If that 
                breaks your IDL files, use the new switch -sloppy_names
                to have the compiler behave as before.)

             Fixed Problems in generated code
                - String members in exceptions and structs are now initialized 
                  to "", otherwise there can be CORBA.MARSHAL exceptions 
                  at runtime because of null values.
                - generated code in multi-dimensional sequences now 
                  compiles with javac.
                - Arrays of anys: generated code now compiles with javac.
                - Corrected references to holder classes for out 
                  parameters for types aliased to string

             Additional bug fixes...

        - added support for inverse DNS lookup of IP addresses, so IORs
          contain fully qualified host names instead of IP numbers. See
          INSTALL file for details.
        
        - added properties "jacorb.ior_proxy_[host|port]" that replace
          the actual host/port where the ORB listens for requests. This
          is for cases where servers are hidden behind proxies / firewalls.
        
        - fixed a bug where a release() or a LocationForward on a shared
          object reference caused the irregular termination of other 
          concurrent requests over that reference.
  
        - added property "custom.props" which can contain a comma separated
          list of additional properties files. These properties will override
          properties set in the jacorb.properties file. This is useful for 
          setups with multiple servers/clients, where each process needs its
          own configuration.   

        - fixed bugs in trader build files (leftover from "org" change).

        - added "auto-register" feature to the ImR. This will register
          servers, that don't need to be restarted automatically, on their 
          first startup, so they don't have to be registered manually. This 
          feature is activated  via a  "-a" switch  to the  ImR process  or 
          by  setting the property "jacorb.imr.allow_auto_register" to "on".

        - renamed property "jacorb.ImplementationRepositoryURL" to 
          "ORBInitRef.ImplementationRepository", so the ImR is available 
          through resolve_initial_references().

        - accepting now ORBInitializer class properties in the form of 
          "org.omg.PortableInterceptor.ORBInitializerClass.<class name>"
          for compliance reasons. Old form of 
          "org.omg.PortableInterceptor.ORBInitializerClass.<name>=<class name>"
          is still supported.


1.3.21
        - internal redesign: all package names now begin with "org.jacorb"
          NOTE: You MUST change existing jacorb.properties files to 
          reflect these changes where property values point to JacORB
          classes, e.g. the value for property:

              org.omg.PortableInterceptor.ORBInitializerClass.standard_init

          must be changed to:

              org.jacorb.orb.standardInterceptors.IORInterceptorInitializer

        - IDL compiler:
                . added the -nostub switch to suppress generation of client stubs
                . added the -sloppy_forward switch for forward declared interfaces
                  without definitions
                . name resolution bug fixed
                . stricter checks in lots of places (thanks to Paul Locke)
                . minor bug fixes

        - Any marshalling bugs for alias types fixed

        - fixed diverse bugs in wstring support

        - enhanced dior tool to display character codeset information

        - fixed minor bug in internal buffer management

        - fixed bug in fallback code after a non-permanent ForwardRequest
          by a portable interceptor

        - added few properties to allow for tailor-made authentication
          implementations (aka PrincipalAuthenticator). Also fixed a 
          few minor glitches in the SSL setup, so that we can now 
          interoperate with, e.g., Orbacus' SSL.

1.3.11:

        - fixed two minor but annoying syntax errors in the source
          code... (jacorb/ir/gui/ModelBuilder.java and 
          jacorb/orb/domain/gui/BrowserFrame.java). Also fixed
          broken jacorb.jar file
