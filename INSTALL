JacORB 1.3.30

		Installing and Building JacORB

_____________________________________________________________________

Required: 

	- JDK 1.1 or later

	- if your are using JDK 1.1 and want to use any GUI features
	  at all, you need to install the swing classes (aka Java 
	  Foundations Classes JFC) downloadable from http://java.sun.com

	- for IIOP over SSL: 
          JDK 1.4 or IAIK crytography provider and SSL implementation, 
          available from http://www.iaik.at

	- for rebuilding JacORB or compling the demos:
	  Version 1.2 or later of the Jakarta Ant make tool,
          available from http://jakarta.apache.org/ant. 

        - for using names instead of ip adresses in IORs:
          dnsjava 1.1.6 (or above) available from 
          http://www.xbill.org/dnsjava. See step 7. for instructions.

	[ This release was tested on Linux (JDK 1.2.2, 1.3.1, 1.4-beta3), Solaris 
	(JDK 1.3.0) and Win2k Sp1 (JDK1.3). ]

Installation:
=============

(0. Download "Ant" and install it as described in its documentation
    if you want to rebuild. This JacORB release relies on Ant 1.2 !!)

1.  For rebuilding, extend your CLASSPATH environment variable to 
    include the following paths, where <jacorb_home> denotes your 
    JacORB installation directory and <ant_home> the Ant installation 
    directory.:

	1) <jacorb>/classes
	2) <ant_home>/lib/ant.jar

2. Extend your search path to include the <jacorb>/bin subdirectory
   of the installation directory so that the JacORB utilities can be
   found. (For rebuilding, ant's /bin directory must also be included.)

3. Copy orb.properties to JAVA_HOME/lib or edit the existing
   orb.properties file.

4. Edit jacorb.properties and copy them to your "home" directory.
   Please use jacorb_properties.template as a template.
   Most options need no configuration, but you must adjust the  
   URL strings

        ORBInitRef.NameService=http://www.x.y.z/~user/NS_Ref
        ORBInitRef.TradingService=http://www.x.y.z/~user/TraderRef
        ORBInitRef.ImplementationRepository=http://www.x.y.z/~user/ImR_Ref
        jacorb.ProxyServerURL=http://www.x.y.z/~user/Appligator_Ref

   to match your domain's web server or local file system structure.
   Please consult the programming guide's section on  setting up the
   name server for details. The trader and the Appligator are located 
   using the same mechanism. If you don't need these services, just
   comment out the coorresponding line in the properties file..

   Also, you can configure how much diagnostic information JacORB
   emits by setting the jacorb.verbosity property. A value of 0
   means no output,  level 1 emits basic connection information, 
   and levels 2 and above are debug levels.

   NOTE: If you are updating from an existing JacORB installation
   you MUST change existing jacorb.properties files to reflect the
   changes in package names (the leading "org.") where property 
   values point to JacORB classes. E.g., the value for property:

      org.omg.PortableInterceptor.ORBInitializerClass.standard_init

   must be changed to:

      org.jacorb.orb.standardInterceptors.IORInterceptorInitializer



5. Generate or edit the start scripts jaco and jaco.bat:
   (This step is carried out automatically by the build
    process, so it is only required if you are not rebuilding
    JacORB).

        a) If you have ant installed, simply call 
            "ant jaco"

        b) If you don't have ant, you need to adapt the jaco(.bat)
           script in bin/ yourself to update the classpath.


6. If you intend to use Appligator with appletviewer, please edit
   bin/jacapplet(.bat) to reflect your local system configuration.

7. If you like to have host names instead of IP adresses in your
   IORs you  have to  install dnsjava (make  its classes  present) 
   and recompile src/org/jacorb/orb/dns. To recompile, do an "ant" 
   in that dir, and an "ant libs" in the JacORB root dir. If 
   you're absolutely sure that you're not using the jacorb.jar, 
   you can omit rebuilding the libs.
   
   If the IP addresses aren't resolved properly / at all, see the
   dnsjava docs on how to set properties to tell dnsjava where to look 
   for the DNS servers.

Building JacORB (Optional)
==========================

   To build JacORB you need to call "ant" in 
   the installation directory as shown below.

	$> ant 
 
   NOTE: 

   The build process may bail out, claiming that javac 
   does not have enough memory. This can happen when trying to
   compile a large number or files at one time. To avoid this
   on Unix, copy the file "antrc" to your home directory renaming it to
   ".antrc". If you are building on a Windows platform copy the 
   antrc_pre.bat file to your home directory (as denoted by %HOME%). 
   ant will consult these files and use a larger Java maximum heap size.
   If this is not applicable in your setting you need to edit 
   ANT_HOME/bin/ant(.bat) such that the java interpreter is passed the 
   -mx48m (or whatever) switch. 
   For Windows add the following line after calling antrc_pre.bat
        set ANT_OPTS=-mx48m %ANT_OPTS%
   For Unix add the following line after sourcing .antrc
        ANT_OPTS=-mx48m $ANT_OPTS

   Yet another way of achieving the same is by setting the 
   ANT_OPTS environment variable:
        set ANT_OPTS=-mx48m
   on Windows, or on Unix:
        export ANT_OPTS=-mx48m
