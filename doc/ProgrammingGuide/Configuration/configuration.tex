This chapter explains the general mechanism how JacORB is configured,
and lists all configuration properties. Note that ORB configuration
has changed from version 2.1 to 2.2, in particular the names and
locations of the standard configuration files have changed.

\section{Properties}

JacORB has a number of configuration options which can be set as Java
properties. There are three options for setting properties: 

\begin{itemize}
\item properties files
\item command line properties, and 
\item properties passed as arguments to ORB.init() in the code of your
  applications.
\end{itemize}

In the case of a process with multiple ORB instances, it may be
required either to share options between ORBs, or to separate
individual configurations from each other. We explain below how
properties can be set for sharing or for individual ORB instances.

\subsection{Properties files}

JacORB looks for and loads a two standard properties files, a common
file called {\tt common.orb.properties}, and an ORB-specific file one
called {\tt <orbid>.orb.properties}, where  {\tt <orbid>} is the name
of an ORB instance. Also, it can load custom properties files from
arbitrary locations. We explain these files in turn.

\subsubsection{The common properties file}

The reason for having a common properties file is that a single JacORB
installation may be shared by a number of users with a set of common
default, properties. These may be refined by users in their own
properties files but still provide reasonable defaults for the
environment. Note that it is not required to have a common properties
file as all configuration options can also be set in other files, or
on the commandline or in the code.

JacORB looks for the common properties file {\tt
  common.orb.properties} in these places:

\begin{enumerate}
\item in the {\tt lib} directory of the JDK installation. (The JDK's
  home directory denoted by the system property "java.home").
\item in the user home directory. (This is denoted by the system
    property "user.home". On Windows, this is
    {\verb+c:\documents\username+}, on Unixes it's {\verb+~user+}. If
    in doubt where your home directory is, write a small Java programm that
  prints out this property.
\item on the class path.
\end{enumerate}

The common properties file is searched in the order presented above,
so you may actually be loading multiple files of this name. If a
properties file is found, it is loaded, and any property values 
will override values of the same property that were loaded earlier.

Loading properties files from the classpath is useful when
distributing applications packaged in JAR files.

\subsubsection{The ORB properties file}

Having ORB-specific properties files is necessary when multiple ORB
instances live in the same process, but need to have separate
configurations, e.g., some ORBs use SSL and others don't, or some ORBs
need to listen on separate but predefined ports. To let colocated ORBs
use and retrieve separate configurations, JacORB provides an
ORB-specific lookup mechanisms based on a specific property, the {\tt
  ORBid}. (The default value for the ORBid is {\tt jacorb}). To use
different configurations, simply pass different ORBid values to your ORBs.

JacORB looks for ORB properties files in these places:

\begin{enumerate}
\item {\tt jacorb.config.dir/etc/orbid.orb.properties.}, if that exists, or
\item {\tt jacorb.home/etc/orbid.orb.properties.}, or 
\item the current directory ({\tt './orbid.orb.properties.'})
\item on the class path.
\end{enumerate}

The {\tt jacorb.config.dir} and {\tt jacorb.home} properties must be
set for JacORB to be able to use a preconfigured configuration
directory. This can be done in the {\tt common.orb.properties} file,
or by passing a property in on the commandline, like this:

\cmdline{jaco -Djacorb.config.dir=c:/ -DORBid=example test.Example}

The commandline above causes JacORB to look for a file called {\tt
  example.orb.properties} in {\tt c:/etc}. If the {\tt
  -DORBid=example} had been ommitted, the name of the ORB properties
file that JacORB would try to load would have been {\tt
  jacorb.orb.properties}, because that is the default value for the
ORBid. A good starting point is to have a common properties file that
sets the {\tt jacorb.config.dir} property, and then have put a {\tt
  jacorb.orb.properties} file in that directory. Note, however, that
the added flexibility of using multiple configuration files may lead
to individual properties defined in multiple files. You must
know the order in which your configuration files are loaded to avoid
  confusion over property settings not having the expected effect!

\subsubsection{Custom properties files}

In addition to the standard JacORB properties files, a {\em custom
  properties file} can be loaded by passing the name of that
properties files the {\tt custom.props} property to JacORB. This can
be handy for application-specific settings that you want to distribute
with your code, e.g.

The value of this property is the path to a properties file, which
contains the properties you want to load. As an example, imagine that
you usually use plain TCP/IP connections, but in some cases want to
use SSL (see section \ref{ch:SSL}). The different ways of achieving
this are

\begin{itemize}
\item Use just one properties file, but you will have to edit that
  file if you want to switch between SSL and
plaintext connections.
\item Use commandline properties exclusively (cf. below), which may lead to very long
commands
\item Use a command property file for all applications and different
  custom properties files for each application.
\end{itemize}

For example, you could start a JacORB program like this:

\cmdline{jaco -Dcustom.props=c:/tmp/ns.props org.jacorb.naming.NameServer}

In addition to loading any standard properties files found in the
places listed above, JacORB will now also load configuration
properties from the file {\tt c:/tmp/ns.props}, but this last file
will be loaded after the default properties files and its values will
thus take precedence over earlier settings.

\subsection{Command-line properties}

In the same way as the {\tt custom.props} property in the example
above, arbitrary other Java properties can be passed to JacORB
programs using the {\tt -D<prop name>=<prop value>} command line syntax
for the {\tt java} interpreter, but can be used in the same way with
the {\tt jaco} script. Note that in any case the properties must
precede the class name on the command line.

The ORB configuration mechanism will
give configuration properties passed in this way precedence over
property values found in configuration files.

\subsection{Arguments to ORB.init()}

For more application--specific properties, you can pass a {\tt
 java.util.Properties} object to {\tt ORB.init()} during application
initialization. Properties set this way will override properties set
by a properties file. The following code snippet demonstrates how to
pass in a {\tt Properties} object ({\tt args} is the String array
containing command line arguments):

\small{
\begin{verbatim}
    java.util.Properties props = new java.util.Properties();
    props.setProperty("jacorb.implname","StandardNS");
    // use put() under Java 1.1

    org.omg.CORBA.ORB orb = org.omg.CORBA.ORB.init(args, props);
\end{verbatim}
}

\section{Common Configuration Options}

We are now ready to have a look at the most basic JacORB configuration
properties. As a starting point, you should look at the file {\tt
  /etc/jacorb\_properties.template}, which you can adapt to your own
needs.

\subsection{Initial references}

Initial references are object references that are available to CORBA
application through the bootstrap {\tt
  orb.resolve\_initial\_service()} API call. This call takes a string
argument as the name of an initial reference and returns a CORBA
object reference, e.g., to the initial name service.

\renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{0.9}
\small{
\begin{verbatim}
########################################
#                                      #
#   Initial references configuration   #
#                                      #
########################################

#
# URLs where IORs are stored (used in orb.resolve_initial_service())
# DO EDIT these! (Only those that you are planning to use,
# of course ;-).
#
# The ORBInitRef references are created on ORB startup time. In the
# cases of the services themselves, this may lead to exceptions being
# displayed (because the services aren't up yet). These exceptions
# are handled properly and cause no harm!

#ORBInitRef.NameService=corbaloc::160.45.110.41:38693/StandardNS/NameServer-POA/_root
#ORBInitRef.NameService=file:/c:/NS_Ref
ORBInitRef.NameService=http://www.x.y.z/~user/NS_Ref
#ORBInitRef.TradingService=http://www.x.y.z/~user/TraderRef
\end{verbatim}
}
\renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{1.0}
\small\normalsize

The  string value  for  {\tt
ORBInitRef.NameService} is  a URL  for a resource  used to set  up the
JacORB name  server. This URL  will be used  by the ORB to  locate the
file  used to  store  the  name server's  object  reference (see  also
chapter \ref{ch:naming}).

\subsection{Logging}

Beginning with version 2.0, JacORB uses external log kit
implementations for writing logs. The default log kit used by JacORB
is the Apache LogKit implementation. To plug in different loggers, you
need to write code for a custom {\tt LoggerFactory} class yourself and
supply the class name as the value of the {\tt
  jacorb.log.loggerFactory} property. Any new factory needs to
implement the interface {\tt org.jacorb.util.LoggerFactory}.

\subsubsection*{Log levels and different log components}

The JacORB logging mechanism can be fine-tuned to set different log
levels for different components of JacORB. It is still possible to
rely only on one single, default log level. This log level is
specified like this (note that the properties have changed from
previous JacORB versions!):

\renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{0.9}
\small{
\begin{verbatim}
##################################
#                                #
#  Default Logging configuration #
#                                #
##################################

# Name of the factory class that plugs in a given log kit
# The default value is JacORB's own factory for the Apache
# LogKit. Only edit (or uncomment) if you want a different
# log kit.
#jacorb.log.loggerFactory=org.jacorb.util.LogKitLoggerFactory

# log levels:
#
# 0 = fatal errors only = "almost off" (FATAL ERRORS)
# 1 = non-fatal errors and exceptions (ERROR)
# 2 = important messages (WARN)
# 3 = informational messages and exceptions (INFO)
# 4 = debug-level output (DEBUG) (may confuse the unaware user :-)
jacorb.log.default.verbosity=3
\end{verbatim}
}
\renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{1.0}
\small\normalsize

For other components, the individual log levels are set using log
properties specific to that component, e.g.,\\
\\
{\tt jacorb.naming.log.verbosity=0}\\
\\
will turn logging off for the naming service, but all other parts of
the ORB will still use the default log level. The general pattern for
the log level property is {\tt jacorb.<component>.log.verbosity}.
Other components are, e.g., poa, or ssl.

\subsubsection*{Logging output to a file}

The properties specific to file logging are the following:

\renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{0.9}
\small{
\begin{verbatim}
# where does output go? Terminal is default
jacorb.logfile=c:/tmp/jacorb.log

# Append to an existing log file or overwrite? (Applies to
# file logging only)
jacorb.logfile.append=on

# If jacorb.logfile.append is on, set rolling log size in kilobytes.
# A value of 0 implies no rolling log
jacorb.logfile.maxLogSize=0
\end{verbatim}
}
\renewcommand{\baselinestretch}{1.0}
\small\normalsize

Unless the {\tt jacorb.logfile} property is set to a file name, output
will be sent to the terminal. The {\tt jacorb.logfile.append} value
tells the logger whether to overwrite existing log files or to append
to the. The {\tt jacorb.logfile.maxLogSize} property, finally,
determines how large a log file may become before the logger
automatically creates a new file. This value is in kilobytes. If it is
set to 0, log files may become arbitrarily large, no log file rotation
is used.

The  {\tt jacorb.poa.monitoring} property  determines whether  the POA
should bring up a monitoring GUI  for servers that let you examine the
dynamic behavior of  your POA, e.g.  how long  the request queue gets
and whether your thread pool is  big enough.  Also, this tool lets you
change the  state of a POA,  e.g. from {\it active}  to {\it holding}.
Please see chapter \ref{ch:POA} on the POA for more details.
