In this chapter  we explain how to obtain and  install JacORB, and give
an overview of the package contents.

\section{Downloading JacORB}


JacORB can be downloaded as a g-zipped tar--archive or as a zip--archive
from the  JacORB home page  at
\href{http://www.jacorb.org}{http://www.jacorb.org}.

To install JacORB, first unzip  and untar (or simply unzip) the archive
somewhere.  This will result  in a new directory {\tt \JacORBDir}.
After this follow the instructions in {\tt \JacORBDir/doc/INSTALL}.

\section{Installation}
\label{Sec_installation}

\subsection{Requirements}

JacORB requires JDK 1.5 or above properly installed on your machine.  To build
JacORB (and compile the examples) you need to have the XML--based make tool
``Ant'' installed on your machine.  Ant can be downloaded from
\href{http://jakarta.apache.org/ant}{http://jakarta.apache.org/ant}. All make
files ({\tt build.xml}) are written for this tool. To rebuild JacORB
completely, just type {\tt ant} in the installation directory.  Optionally,
you might want to do a {\tt ant clean} first.

For SSL, you need an implementation of the SSL protocol. We currently support:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Sun's JSSE Reference implementation included in the JDK.
\end{enumerate}
