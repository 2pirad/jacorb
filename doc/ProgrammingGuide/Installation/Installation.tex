In this chapter  we explain how to obtain and  install JacORB, and give
an overview of the package contents.

\section{Downloading JacORB}


JacORB can be downloaded as a g-zipped tar--archive or as a zip--archive
from the  JacORB home page  at
\href{http://www.jacorb.org}{http://www.jacorb.org}.

To install JacORB, first unzip  and untar (or simply unzip) the archive
somewhere.  This will result  in a new directory {\tt \JacORBDir}.
After this follow the instructions in {\tt \JacORBDir/doc/INSTALL}.

\section{Installation}
\label{Sec_installation}

\subsection{Requirements}

JacORB requires JDK 1.3 or above properly installed on your machine.  To build
JacORB (and compile the examples) you need to have the XML--based make tool
``Ant'' installed on your machine.  Ant can be downloaded from
\href{http://jakarta.apache.org/ant}{http://jakarta.apache.org/ant}. All make
files ({\tt build.xml}) are written for this tool. To rebuild JacORB
completely, just type {\tt ant} in the installation directory.  Optionally,
you might want to do a {\tt ant clean} first.

For SSL, you need an implementation of the SSL protocol. We currently support:

\begin{enumerate}
\item IAIK's
  \footnote{\href{http://jcewww.iaik.tu-graz.ac.at}{http://jcewww.iaik.tu-graz.ac.at/}}
  implementation consisting of the crypto provider IAIK--JCE 2.5 (or higher)
  and the SSL library iSaSiLk 3.0 (or higher). Using this implementation
  allows you to access the clients authenticated certificates.
\item Sun's JSSE Reference implementation included in the JDK 1.4 .
\end{enumerate}
