# This file defines which JacORB versions are available to run tests against.
# For each available version, an id, a home directory, and a launcher class
# must be specified (the exception is that for "cvs", no home directory needs
# to be set because the "cvs" version lives in the same tree as the regression
# suite).

# The "launcher" must be a subclass of org.jacorb.test.common.launch.JacORBLauncher.
# Currently, there are two classes defined: JacoLauncher, which launches against
# the specified JacORB version using the jaco script from that version, and
# DirectLauncher, which directly invokes a JVM with appropriate arguments.
