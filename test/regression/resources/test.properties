# This file defines which JacORB versions are available to run tests against.
# For each available version, an id, a home directory, and a launcher class
# must be specified (the exception is that for "cvs", no home directory needs
# to be set because the "cvs" version lives in the same tree as the regression
# suite).

# The "launcher" must implement the interface org.jacorb.test.common.launch.Launcher.
# Currently, there are three classes defined: JacoLauncher, which launches against
# the specified JacORB version using the jaco script from that version,
# DirectLauncher, which directly invokes a JVM with appropriate arguments
# and TaoLauncher which will invoke a TAO process.
# for convenience you can extend the abstract class AbstractLauncher

# jacorb.test.jacorb_version.<x>.id=<name>
#    logical name which will be referenced from the testsuite. must be unique

# jacorb.test.jacorb_version.<x>.launcher=<direct|jaco|tao|classname>
#    classname of the launcher or one of the shortcuts direct, jaco or tao

# jacorb.test.jacorb_version.<x>.home=<dir>
#    home directory of the other jacorb installation. missing home directory or the shortcut cvs will
#    default to the JacORB installation the tests are run from.

# jacorb.test.jacorb_version.<x>.property.<propname>=<value>
#    allows you to pass in custom properties to the launcher
