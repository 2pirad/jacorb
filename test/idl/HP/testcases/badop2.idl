/**
 * Another bad operation definition. 
 * In my view, this IDL should be illegal as exception
 * types are being used as parameters and arguments to
 * operations. This could be up for debate but, as a purist,
 * I think we should regard exceptions as "special" types. 
 * CORBA spec does not. however forbid this. 
 * RESULT: SUCCESS
 * REMARK: This IDL is accepted by the compiler and code generated.
 *         Java itself does permit exceptions to be passed as
 *         parameters and returned from methods.
