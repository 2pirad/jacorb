/**
 * This IDL example comprises merely a forward declaration

 * This is syntactically correct IDL though semantically
 * vacuous. The compiler should at least parse correctly. 
 * RESULT: FAILURE
 * REMARK: infinite loop in Jacorb compiler. Completion
 *         in OpenORB compiler (though obviously no code generation)
