This test is designed to show how jacorb.orb.Delegate can block other threads
wanting to do benign functions such as comparing profiles when attempting to
communicate with an unresponsive server.

The command line is:
jaco -cp ../../classes test.delegateSync.Test 10.203.240.202

where 10.203.240.202 is simply some unreachable address used to compose a
corbaloc string. Alternatively, the test will take a file:// or corbaloc:
string as an argument to facilitate automated testing.
