     * Returns the <code>Class</code> object for the class or interface
     * with the given string name. This method is a replacement for
     * <code>Class.forName(String name)</code>. Unlike
     * <code>Class.forName(String name)</code> (which always uses the
     * caller's loader or one of its ancestors), <code>classForName</code>
     * uses a thread-specific loader that has no delegation relationship
     * with the caller's loader. It attempts the load the desired class
     * with the thread-specific context class loader and falls back to
     * <code>Class.forName(String name)</code> only if the context class
     * loader cannot load the class.
     * <p>
     * Loading a class with a loader that is not necessarily an ancestor
     * of the caller's loader is a crucial thing in many scenarios. As an
     * example, assume that JacORB was loaded by the boot class loader,
     * and suppose that some code in JacORB contains a call
     * <code>Class.forName(someUserClass)</code>. Such usage of
     * <code>Class.forName</code> effectively forces the user to place
     * <code>someUserClass</code> in the boot class path. If
     * <code>classForName(someUserClass)</code> were used instead, the user
     * class would be loaded by the context class loader, which by default
     * is set to the system (CLASSPATH) classloader.
     * <p>
     * In this simple example above, the default setting of the context class
     * loader allows classes in the boot classpath to reach classes in the
     * system classpath. In other scenarios, the context class loader might
     * be different from the system classloader. Middleware systems like
     * servlet containers or EJB containers set the context class loader so
     * that a given thread can reach user-provided classes that are not in
     * the system classpath.
     * <p>
     * For maximum flexibility, <code>classForName</code> should replace
     * <code>Class.forName(String name)</code> in nearly all cases.
     *
     * @param name the fully qualified name of a class
     *
     * @return the Class object for that class
     *
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if <code>name</code> is null
     * @throws ClassNotFoundException if the named class cannot be found
     * @throws LinkageError if the linkage fails
