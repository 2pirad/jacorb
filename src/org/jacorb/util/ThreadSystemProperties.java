/**
 * This class provides thread specific system
 * properties, i.e., a call to System.setProperty()
 * does not alter the properties accessible by
 * System.getProperty() from any other thread. <br>
 *
 * Properties are inherited downwards, i.e., if a
 * thread creates a new thread, that child will get
 * a copy of its parents threads properties. <br>
 *
 * WARNING: The use of any other methods than getProperty(),
 * setProperty() and propertyNames(), may result in 
 * unintended behavior. On the other hand, put() and get()
 * might be used for a set of properties, common to all
 * threads.
