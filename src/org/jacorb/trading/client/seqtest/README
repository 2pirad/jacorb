The export program exports some sample service offers for the
'SeqSvc' type defined in the typemgr/examples subdirectory.
The program uses the CosTrading::Register object as the offer's
object reference.  The program is useful for testing offers
with sequence properties.

The SeqTest IDL file contains definitions for various sequence types
that are used by the export program.

To run it, make sure the IDL-generated classes are in your CLASSPATH,
and type

  % java jtclient.seqtest.export iorfile

where iorfile is the name of a file containing the IOR of the trading
service's Lookup object.
