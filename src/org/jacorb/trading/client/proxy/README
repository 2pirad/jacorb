This directory contains a demonstration server that supports proxy
offers.

To run it, make sure the IDL-generated classes are in your CLASSPATH,
and type

  % java jtclient.proxy.ProxyDemo -i iorfile

where iorfile is the name of a file which will contain the IOR of the
server's proxy Lookup object.


The export program exports some sample proxy offers for the
'SubSvc' type defined in the typemgr/examples subdirectory.

To run it, make sure the IDL-generated classes are in your CLASSPATH,
and type

  % java jtclient.proxy.export trader-iorfile proxy-iorfile

where trader-iorfile contains the IOR of the trading service's Lookup
object, and proxy-iorfile contains the IOR of the proxy Lookup object.


NOTE:  Since the IOR of the demonstration server object is recorded in
  the exported service offers, you might want to take whatever steps are
  required for your ORB to ensure that the object's IOR is valid beyond
  a single execution of the server (i.e. assign a port, an object name, etc.).
