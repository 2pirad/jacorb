Query is a simple graphical application for performing queries.

To run it, make sure the IDL-generated classes are in your CLASSPATH,
and type

  % jaco org.jacorb.trading.client.query.Query iorfile

where iorfile is the name of a file containing the IOR of the trading
service's Lookup object.

Most of the fields should be self-explanatory, but here's a brief
description:

  * Constraint - This field is required (the simplest constraint is "TRUE")
  * Preference - This field is optional (the default is "first")
  * Desired properties - If unchecked, all properties will be retrieved.
    If checked, specify zero or more property names separated by commas.
  * Exact type - Represents the "exact_type_match" policy.  If checked,
    only service offers of the selected type will be considered.  Otherwise,
    service offers of the selected type, and any of its subtypes, will be
    considered.
  * Dynamic properties - Represents the "use_dynamic_properties" policy.
    If checked, offers with dynamic properties will be considered.
