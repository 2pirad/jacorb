/**
 * Implementation of COSEventChannelAdmin interface; ProxyPullSupplier.
 * This defines connect_pull_consumer(), disconnect_pull_supplier() and the all
 * important pull() and try_pull() methods that the Consumer can call to
 * actuall deliver a message.
 *
 * 2002/23/08 JFC OMG EventService Specification 1.1 page 2-7 states:
 *      "Registration is a two step process.  An event-generating application
 *      first obtains a proxy consumer from a channel, then 'connects' to the
 *      proxy consumer by providing it with a supplier.  ...  The reason for
 *      the two step registration process..."
 *    Modifications to support the above have been made as well as to support
 *    section 2.1.5 "Disconnection Behavior" on page 2-4.
