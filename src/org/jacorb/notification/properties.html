<H1>JacORB Notification Service Properties</H1>
</center>

    Following is a brief description of the properties
    that control Notification Service behaviour.

    <h1>Concurrency</h1>

    The Notification Service uses up to three Thread Pools with a configurable
    size. The first Thread Pool is used to process the filtering of the
    Messages. The second Thread Pool is used to deliver the Messages to the
    Consumers. The third Thread Pool us used to pull Messages from PullSuppliers. 

    <h2>jacorb.notification.filter.thread_pool_size</h2>
    
    default: 2 <br>
    unit: int >= 0 <br>

    This is the Size of the Thread Pool used to process the filters.
    Increasing this value on a Multiprocessor machine or if Filters are on
    a different machine than the Channel could increase the Filtering
    Performance as multiple events can be processed concurrently.


    <h2 id="proxysupplier.thread_pool_size">jacorb.notification.proxysupplier.thread_pool_size</h2>

    default: 4 <br>
    unit: int >= 0 <br>

    This is the Size of the Thread Pool used to deliver the Messages to
    the Consumers. By using the property <a
    href="#proxysupplier.threadpolicy">jacorb.notification.proxysupplier.threadpolicy</a> 
    it is also possible to use one Thread per ProxySupplier.


    <h2>jacorb.notification.proxyconsumer.thread_pool_size</h2>

    default: 2 <br>
    unit: int >= 0<br>

    Specifies the Size of the Thread Pool used to pull Messages from PullSuppliers


    <h2 id="proxysupplier.threadpolicy">jacorb.notification.proxysupplier.threadpolicy</h2>
    default: ThreadPool
    unit: String
    valid values: ThreadPool, ThreadPerProxy.

    Specify which thread policy the ProxySuppliers should use to deliver
    the Messages to its Consumers. Valid values are: 

    <ul>
      <li>ThreadPool: A <a
	href="#proxysupplier.thread_pool_size">fixed number</a> of threads is used. 
      </li>
      
      <li>ThreadPerProxy: Each ProxySupplier uses its own thread </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>jacorb.notification.supplier.poll_intervall</h2>
    
    default: 1000 <br>
    unit: ms <br>

    Specifies how often Messages should be pulled from a PullSupplier. The
    value specifies the intervall between two pull-Operations (in
    milliseconds). 


    <h1>Channel Limits</h1>

    <h2>jacorb.notification.supplier.max_number</h2>
    default: Integer.MAX_VALUE<br>
    unit: int > 0<br>

    Specify the maximum number of Suppliers that may be connected to a
    Channel at a time. If a Supplier tries to connect, while this
    limit is exceeded, AdminLimitExceeded is raised. Note that this
    property can also be set programatically via the <code>set_admin</code> operation.

    <h2>jacorb.notification.consumer.max_number</h2>
    default: Integer.MAX_VALUE<br>
    unit: int > 0<br>

    Specify the maximum number of Consumers that may be connected to a
    Channel at a time. If a Consumer tries to connect, while this
    limit is exceeded, AdminLimitExceeded is raised. Note that this
    property can also be set programatically via the <code>set_admin</code> operation.

    <h2 id="max_events_per_consumer">jacorb.notification.max_events_per_consumer</h2>

    default: 100 <br>
    unit: int >= 0<br>

    Specifies how many Events a ProxySupplier at most should queue for a
    consumer. If this number is exceeded Events are discarded according to
    the <a href="#discard_policy">DiscardPolicy</a> configured for the ProxySupplier.
    
    <h2>jacorb.notification.max_batch_size</h2>

    default: 1 <br>
    unit: int <br>

    Specifies the maximal number of Messages a SequencePushSupplier should
    queue before a delivery to its connected SequencedPushConsumer is
    forced. 


    <h1>Queuing</h1>

    <h2>jacorb.notification.order_policy</h2>

    default: PriorityOrder <br>
    unit: String <br>
    valid values: AnyOrder, PriorityOrder, DeadlineOrder,
    FifoOrder. <br>

    Specify how events that are queued should be ordered. 

    <h2 id="discard_policy">jacorb.notification.discard_policy</h2>

    default: PriorityOrder <br>
    unit: String <br>
    valid values: AnyOrder, PriorityOrder, DeadlineOrder,
    FifoOrder, LifoOrder. <br>

    Specifies which Events are discarded if more than the <a
    href="#max_events_per_consumer">maximal number</a> 
    of events are queued for a consumer.

    <h1>Error handling</h1>

    <h2>jacorb.notification.consumer.backout_interval</h2>

    default: 1000 <br>
    unit: ms <br>
    
    After a delivery to a Consumer has failed the Channel will disable
    delivery to that Consumer for a while before retrying. This property
    specifies how long a consumer should stay disabled.

    <h2>jacorb.notification.consumer.error_threshold</h2>
    default: 3 <br>
    unit: int > 0<br>

    Each failed delivery to a consumer increments an errorcounter. If this
    errorcounter exceeds the specified value the consumer is
    disconnected from the channel.


    <h1>Other</h1>    

    <h2>jacorb.notification.default_filter_factory</h2>
    default: builtin<br>
    unit: String (objectref)<br>
    
    Specify which FilterFactory (<code>CosNotifyFilter::FilterFactory</code>) the
    attribute <code>EventChannel::default_filter_factory</code> should be set to. 
    Default value is <em>builtin</em>. This special value implies that a
    FilterFactory will be created during start of the EventChannel.
    Its possible to set this property to a URL that points to another
    <code>CosNotifyFilter::FilterFactory</code> object. In this case no FilterFactory
    is started by the EventChannel. The URL is resolved by a call
    to <code>ORB::string_to_object</code>.
