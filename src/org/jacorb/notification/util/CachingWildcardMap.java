/**
 * Add Caching to WildcardMap. If the Keys inside the Map contain the
 * Wildcard Operator '*' the Operation getWithExpansion is rather expensive.
 * For each Key that contains a '*' a pattern match must be done. This
 * Subclass adds simple Caching. When a key is looked up the retrieved
 * value is stored in an internal cache with fixed size. Subsequent
 * getWithExpansion Operations query the cache first. As soon as a put
 * or remove Operation occurs the Cache is invalidated.
