/* 
 * We follow the design of socket factories in package javax.net and 
 * javax.net.ssl. Because this package isn't in the JDK yet we don't 
 * extend its classes, but we are fully compatible.
 *
 * The basic idea is to setup policies related to the sockets being 
 * constructed, in the factory: no special configuration is done in 
 * the code which asks for the sockets.
