/**
 * A special ReplyPlaceholder that is used for normal client requests,
 * which can be both synchronous and asynchronous.  A ReplyReceiver
 * handles all ORB-internal work that needs to be done for the reply, 
 * such as checking for exceptions and invoking the interceptors.
 * The client stub can either do a blocking wait on the ReplyReceiver 
 * (via getInputStream()), or a ReplyHandler can be supplied when the 
 * ReplyReceiver is created; then the reply is delivered to that 
 * ReplyHandler.
