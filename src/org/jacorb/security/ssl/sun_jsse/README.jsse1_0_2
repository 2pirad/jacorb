To be able to compile the classes in this package with a JDK < 1.4 and
the downloadable JSSE 1.0.2, you have to take the following steps:

1.) Apply the patches (kindly provided by Stephan Feder [sf@b-i-t.de])
    by running "ant patch" (or using patch manually). You can remove
    the patches by running "ant unpatch".

2.) Recompile by running "ant".

3.) Rebuild the libs by running "ant libs" in JacORBs root dir.
