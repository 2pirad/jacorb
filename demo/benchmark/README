Objective:
    A simple benchmark for remote invocations. It takes the system clock right
    before and after method invocations. Can choose simple ping, transfer of 
    array of ints, or transfer of array of structs, plus size of structs and 
    number of loops.
    
    There is also a simple example for local invocations using ColocatedServer 
    
How to Run:
    Compile:
        ant

    Run NamingServer:
        ns -Djacorb.naming.ior_filename=/path/to/NS_Ref

    Run Server:
        jaco demo.benchmark.Server

    Run Client:
        jaco demo.bemnchmark.Client

    Inorder to test colocated cerver invocations run naming server, then
    server as explained above.  Finally run ColocatedServer as:
        jaco demo.benchmark.ColocatedServer

Note:
    Make sure that jacorb.properties is in place(in the current dir) and has 
    the name server reference such as -
    ORBInitRef.NameService=file:/path/to/NS_Ref
