Objective:
    A simple benchmark for remore invocations. It takes the system clock right
    before and after method invocations.Can choose simple ping, transfer of 
    array of ints, or transfer of array of structs, plus size of structs and 
    number of loops.
    
    There is also a simple example for local invocations using ColocatedServer 
    

How to Run:
    Compile:
        ant
    Run NamingServer:
        ns.bat c:/prahalad/NS_Ref
    Run Server:
        jacotemplate.bat demo.benchmark.Server
    Run Client:
        jacotemplate.bat demo.bemnchmark.Client

    Inorder to test Colocated Server invocations
    Run Naming server, then Server as explained above. 
    Then Run ClolocatedServer as:
        jacotemplate.bat demo.benchmark.ColocatedServer
Note:
    Make sure ns.bat is using jacotemplate.bat because there is no jaco.bat in
    this cvs version of the JacORB.

    Make sure ts.bat is using jacotemplate.bat because there is no jaco.bat in
    this cvs version of the JacORB.
	
    Make sure that jacorb.properties is in place(in the current dir) and has 
    the name server reference such as -
    ORBInitRef.NameService=file:/c:/prahalad/NS_Ref
