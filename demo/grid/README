Objective:
    This is a simple example shows how to get and set valus into a two 
    dimentional arry of BigDecimal Numbers(fixed type). 
    This also shows a simple implementation of creating throwing user exceptions.
    There are two different server implemenations one based on inheritance
    which extends XXXPOA, another based on Deligation XXXTie.
    
    
How to Run:
    Compile:
        ant
    Run NamingServer:
        ns c:/prahalad/NS_Ref
    Run Server:
        if Inheritance Model is used
            jaco demo.grid.Server
        if Delegation model is used
            jaco demo.grid.TieServer
    Run Client:
        jaco demo.grid.Client

Note: Make sure that jacorb.properties is in place and has the name server reference
      as ORBInitRef.NameService=file:/c:/prahalad/NS_Ref. Same as the IOR file mentioned
      while starting up the naming server
