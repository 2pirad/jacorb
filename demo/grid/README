    This is a simple example shows how to get and set values into a 
    two-dimensional array of BigDecimal Numbers(fixed type). 

    This also shows a simple implementation of creating throwing user
    exceptions. There are two different server implemenations, one 
    based on inheritance which extends XXXPOA, another based on 
    delegation XXXTie (aka "the tie approach").
    
    
How to Run:
    Compile:
        ant
    Run NamingServer:
        ns c:/NS_Ref
    Run Server:
        if the inheritance model is used
            jaco demo.grid.Server
        if the delegation model is used
            jaco demo.grid.TieServer
    Run Client:
        jaco demo.grid.Client

Note:

  Make sure that jacorb.properties is in place and has the name server
  reference as ORBInitRef.NameService=file:/c:/NS_Ref. Same as the IOR
  file mentioned while starting up the naming server
