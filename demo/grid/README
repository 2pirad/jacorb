    This is a simple example shows how to get and set values into a
    two-dimensional array of BigDecimal Numbers(fixed type).

    This also shows a simple implementation of creating and throwing user
    exceptions. There are two different server implemenations, one based on
    inheritance which extends XXXPOA, another based on delegation XXXTie (aka
    "the tie approach").
    
How to Run:

    Compile:
        ant

    Run NamingServer:
        ns -Djacorb.naming.ior_filename=/path/to/NS_Ref

    Run Server:
        if the inheritance model is used
            jaco demo.grid.Server

        if the delegation model is used
            jaco demo.grid.TieServer

    Run Client:
        jaco demo.grid.Client

Note:

    Make sure that jacorb.properties is in place and has the name server
    reference such as - ORBInitRef.NameService=file:/path/to/NS_Ref
