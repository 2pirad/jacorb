Objective:
    To test generic way of passing parameters as ANY, encapsulating the real
    parameter type.

How to Run:
    Compile:
        ant
    Run NamingServer:
        ns.bat c:/prahalad/NS_Ref
    Run Server:
        jacotemplate.bat demo.any.Server
    Run Client:
        jacotemplate.bat demo.any.Client

Note:
    Make sure ns.bat is using jacotemplate.bat because there is no jaco.bat in
    this cvs version of the JacORB.
	
    Make sure that jacorb.properties is in place and has the name server 
    reference such as ORBInitRef.NameService=file:/c:/prahalad/NS_Ref
