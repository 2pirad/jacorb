Objective:
    This is a simple example shows how the out parameters are used and 
    implemented. 
    Out parameters defined in the IDL construts are mapped to corresponding
    XXXHolder classes generated by the IDL compiler. These out parameters of 
    various types multi dymentional string arrays and structs. 
    
How to Run:
    Compile:
        ant
    Run NamingServer:
        ns.bat c:/prahalad/NS_Ref
    Run Server:
        jacotemplate.bat demo.outparam.Server
    Run Client:
        jacotemplate.bat demo.outparam.Client

Note:
    Make sure ns.bat is using jacotemplate.bat because there is no jaco.bat in
    this cvs version of the JacORB.

    Make sure that jacorb.properties is in place(in the current dir) and has 
    the name server reference such as -
    ORBInitRef.NameService=file:/c:/prahalad/NS_Ref
