Objective:

    This is a simple example shows how out parameters are used and
    implemented. Out parameters defined in the IDL constructs are mapped to
    corresponding XXXHolder classes generated by the IDL compiler. This demo
    has out parameters of various types, e.g. multidimensional string arrays
    and structs.
    
How to Run:
    Compile:
        ant

    Run NamingServer:
        ns -Djacorb.naming.ior_filename=/path/to/NS_Ref

    Run Server:
        jaco demo.outparam.Server
    Run Client:
        jaco demo.outparam.Client

Note:
    Make sure that jacorb.properties is in place (in the current dir) and has 
    the name server reference such as -
    ORBInitRef.NameService=file:/path/to/NS_Ref
