Objective:
    This is a simple example shows how the out parameters are used and 
    implemented. 
    Out parameters defined in the IDL construts are mapped to corresponding
    XXXHolder classes generated by the IDL compiler. These out parameters of 
    various types multi dymentional string arrays and structs. 
    
How to Run:
    Compile:
        ant
    Run NamingServer:
        ns[.bat] -Djacorb.naming.ior_filename=/path/to/NS_Ref
    Run Server:
        jaco[.bat] demo.outparam.Server
    Run Client:
        jaco[.bat] demo.outparam.Client

Note:
    Make sure that jacorb.properties is in place (in the current dir) and has 
    the name server reference such as -
    ORBInitRef.NameService=file:/path/to/NS_Ref
