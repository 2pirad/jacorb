Objective:
   This demo shows how to start transtactions explicitly. How to rollback in 
   case of any failure in the process of transaction.Code is taken and adapted
   from http://www.wiley.com/combooks/vogel/ejb/code.html

How to Run:
    Compile:
        ant
    Run NamingServer:
        ns.bat c:/prahalad/NS_Ref
    Run Transaction Server
        ts.bat
    Run Server:
        jacotemplate.bat demo.bank.transaction.explicit.Server
    Run Client:
        jacotemplate.bat demo.bank.transaction.explicit.Client
Note:
    Make sure ns.bat is using jacotemplate.bat because there is no jaco.bat in
    this cvs version of the JacORB.

    Make sure ts.bat is using jacotemplate.bat because there is no jaco.bat in
    this cvs version of the JacORB.
	
    Make sure that jacorb.properties is in place and has the name server 
    reference such as ORBInitRef.NameService=file:/c:/prahalad/NS_Ref
