Objective:
    This is a simple example that simulates multiple clients sending
    concurrent requests to the server. It also demonstrates the use of oneway
    methods to track which thread has been updated. This is part of the
    observer interface.

How to Run:
    Compile:
        ant

    Run NamingServer:
        ns -Djacorb.naming.ior_filename=/path/to/NS_Ref

    Run Server:
        jaco demo.mtclient.Server

    Run Client:
        jaco demo.mtclient.Client

Note:
    Make sure that jacorb.properties is in place (in the current dir) and has 
    the name server reference such as -
    ORBInitRef.NameService=file:/path/to/NS_Ref
