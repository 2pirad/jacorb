Objective:
    This is a simple example simulates multiple clients requesting the server.
    It also demonstrates use of oneway methods, which are used to track which
    thread is got updated. This is part of the observer interface.

How to Run:
    Compile:
        ant
    Run NamingServer:
        ns.bat c:/prahalad/NS_Ref
    Run Server:
        jacotemplate.bat demo.mtclient.Server
    Run Client:
        jacotemplate.bat demo.mtclient.Client

Note:
    Make sure ns.bat is using jacotemplate.bat because there is no jaco.bat in
    this cvs version of the JacORB.

    Make sure that jacorb.properties is in place(in the current dir) and has 
    the name server reference such as -
    ORBInitRef.NameService=file:/c:/prahalad/NS_Ref
