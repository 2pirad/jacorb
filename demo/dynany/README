Objective:
    This example shows how to create and use DynamicAny objects. This 
    demonstrates many of the types including char, string, arrays, enum, 
    structs.
    
    
How to Run:
    Compile:
        ant
    Run NamingServer:
        ns.bat c:/prahalad/NS_Ref
    Run Server:
        jacotemplate.bat demo.dynany.Server
    Run Client:
        jacotemplate.bat demo.dynany.Client

Note:
    Make sure ns.bat is using jacotemplate.bat because there is no jaco.bat in
    this cvs version of the JacORB.

    Make sure that jacorb.properties is in place(in the current dir) and has 
    the name server reference such as -
    ORBInitRef.NameService=file:/c:/prahalad/NS_Ref
