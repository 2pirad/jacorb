Objective:
    This example shows how to create and handle (implement) Dynamic Interface 
    Invocations. The client creates requests dynamically and invokes them.
    DiiServer shows how to resolve these dynamic invocations, including 
    throwing exceptions. 
    
How to Run:
    Compile:
        ant

    Run NamingServer:
        ns -Djacorb.naming.ior_filename=/path/to/NS_Ref

    Run Server:
        jaco demo.dii.DiiServer

    Run Client:
        jaco demo.dii.Client

Note:
    Make sure that jacorb.properties is in place(in the current dir) and has 
    the name server reference such as -
    ORBInitRef.NameService=file:/path/to/NS_Ref
