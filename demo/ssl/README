        What is it good for?
        --------------------
The purpose of this demo is to show two things:
1.) How to configure SSL for jacorb
2.) How to get the clients certificates from the inside of
    a CORBA object (only with IAIKs packages)

For the configuration part are the two "XX_props" files. Apart from
the keystores, they only differ in the first entry for the
server. This loads a specific interceptor that is necessary for
accessing the clients certificate from within a CORBA object. You can
use the property "jacorb.security.trustees", which contains the
trusted certificates, to play around and see how SSL reacts to
untrusted certificates. You can also play around with the
authentication schemes, that is mutual authentication or server-only.
For more details on the configuration, please see the corresponding
chapter in the programming guide.
