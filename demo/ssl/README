        What is it good for?
        --------------------
The purpose of this demo is to show two things:
1.) How to configure SSL for jacorb
2.) How to get the clients certificates from the inside of
    a CORBA object

For the configuration part are the two "XX_props" files. Apart from
the keystores, they only differ in the first entry for the
server. This loads a specific interceptor that is necessary for
accessing the clients certificate from within a CORBA object. You can
use the property "jacorb.security.trustees", which contains the
trusted certificates, to play around and see how SSL reacts to
untrusted certificates. You can also play around with the
authentication schemes, that is mutual authentication or server-only.
For more details on the configuration, please see the corresponding
chapter in the programming guide.
 
        How to run this demo?
        ---------------------
For the server:
$> jaco -Dcustom.props=server_props demo.ssl.Server ior

For the client:
$> jaco -Dcustom.props=client_props demo.ssl.Client ior

       Running this demo with Sun JSSE (SDK 1.4+)
       ------------------------------------------
       
For the server:
$> jaco -Dcustom.props=jsse_server_props demo.ssl.Server ior

For the client:
$> jaco -Dcustom.props=jsse_client_props demo.ssl.Client ior

       How to generate the JSSE keystores
       ----------------------------------
       
There is a keystore each for the server and client. Aside from their own
key pair each store contains the (trusted) certificate of the other party.

The existing keystores should last till mid summer 2036. But if you're
curious...
