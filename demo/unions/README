    This is a simple example shows how to use unions in sending(in) and 
    receiving(out) as parameters.
    
    Compile:
        ant

    Run NamingServer:
        ns -Djacorb.naming.ior_filename=/path/to/NS_Ref

    Run Server:
        jaco demo.unions.Server

    Run Client:
        jaco demo.unions.Client

    Make sure that jacorb.properties is in place and has 
    the name server reference such as -
    ORBInitRef.NameService=file:/path/to/NS_Ref
