Objective:
    This is a simple example shows how to use unions in sending(in) and 
    receiving(out) as parameters.
    
How to Run:
    Compile:
        ant
    Run NamingServer:
        ns.bat c:/prahalad/NS_Ref
    Run Server:
        jacotemplate.bat demo.unions.Server
    Run Client:
        jacotemplate.bat demo.unions.Client
Note:
    Make sure ns.bat is using jacotemplate.bat because there is no jaco.bat in
    this cvs version of the JacORB.

    Make sure that jacorb.properties is in place(in the current dir) and has 
    the name server reference such as -
    ORBInitRef.NameService=file:/c:/prahalad/NS_Ref
