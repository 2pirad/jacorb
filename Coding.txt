            JacORB Coding Conventions
	    =========================


(Please remember: The ultimate goal is code readability, not
 personal style!)


1) Use whitespace to make the text more readable, it helps!

    a) indentation: 4 spaces

    b) Open curly brackets on a *new* line without further indentation

       if( x )
       {
       }

    c) always write the body of an if-, for-, while- ... statmement 
       on a new line, never on the same!

       for( ;; )
       {
	  ...
       }

    d) write: x = y, not: x=y

    e) break lines that get too long

    f) insert empty lines freely wherever you think it helps.

2) Comment as much as you can!

3) Suggestions?
