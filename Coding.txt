            JacORB Coding Conventions
	    =========================


(Please remember: The ultimate goal is code readability, not
 performance or personal style. Performance-related code obfuscation should
 be limited to a few sensitive places - and explained in comments!)

The astyle tool (http://astyle.sourceforge.net/) can be used to format 
source code:

       astyle -j -s4 -b -P --convert-tabs --break-blocks 


1) Use whitespace to make the text more readable.

    a) indentation: 4 spaces, no tabs!

    b) Open curly brackets on a *new* line without further indentation

       if( x )
       {
       }

    c) always write the body of an if-, for-, while- ... statmement 
       on a new line, never on the same!

       for( ;; )
       {
	  ...
       }

    d) write: x = y, not: x=y

    e) Include extra spaces between parenthesis and expression, and
       around operators
       For example:
 
             if( foo )
             a = b * c

    e) break lines that get too long  (around column 100)

    f) insert empty lines freely wherever you think it helps.


2) Comments:
    - as much as you can, 
         public and package local methods and fields!!!
         private and protected ones also
    - add javadoc wherever you modify code

3) Place the JacORB LGPL license header on all files
